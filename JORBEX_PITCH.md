# JORBEX — Africa's Talent Infrastructure

---

## Section 1: Core Functions & The Pain Points We Solve

### The Problem

Africa has 1.4 billion people. Over 60% are under 25. The continent produces millions of graduates, skilled tradespeople, and professionals every year. Yet unemployment across Sub-Saharan Africa hovers between 30–50% for youth, and employers — both local and international — consistently say they can't find qualified talent.

This isn't a talent problem. It's an infrastructure problem.

There is no trusted, continent-wide system that verifies talent, matches it to opportunity, and manages the hiring process end-to-end. What exists today is fragmented: WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn (designed for Western markets), local job boards with no verification, and recruitment agencies that charge 20–30% of annual salary.

Jorbex fixes this.

---

### 1. For Employees (Talent) in Africa

**Pain points we solve:**

- **Invisibility.** Millions of qualified Africans have no way to present themselves professionally to employers beyond their immediate network. There's no pan-African profile system. A software developer in Lagos, a finance analyst in Nairobi, and a marketing specialist in Dakar are all invisible to the broader market. Jorbex gives every candidate a verified, multilingual professional profile that works across borders.

- **No way to prove competence.** A degree from a university in Cameroon or Nigeria carries different weight depending on who's reading it. Employers don't trust CVs alone. Jorbex's aptitude verification system lets candidates take standardized assessments and earn verified scores. This creates a portable proof of competence that travels with them — independent of which school they attended or who they know.

- **Language barriers.** Africa has thousands of languages, but business operates in English, French, Arabic, and Portuguese. A talented accountant in Senegal shouldn't be locked out of opportunities in Nigeria because the platform only speaks English. Jorbex operates natively in all four major African business languages.

- **No access to global opportunities.** Remote work has exploded globally, but African talent is largely excluded from the pipeline. International employers don't know where to look, and African candidates don't know how to present themselves to global standards. Jorbex bridges this gap.

- **Exploitative recruitment.** Many African job seekers pay agents and middlemen for job leads that go nowhere. Jorbex is free for candidates. Always.

### 2. For Employers in Africa

**Pain points we solve:**

- **Hiring takes too long and costs too much.** The average time-to-hire in Africa is 45–90 days. Recruitment agencies charge 15–30% of annual salary. Jorbex cuts both. Employers post jobs, receive applications from pre-verified candidates, run custom aptitude tests, schedule video interviews, and extend offers — all in one platform.

- **No reliable way to assess candidates.** CVs are unreliable. References are hard to verify. Jorbex provides aptitude scores, verified profiles, and a structured evaluation pipeline so employers can make data-driven hiring decisions instead of gut-feel ones.

- **Cross-border hiring is a nightmare.** An employer in South Africa trying to hire in Kenya faces different languages, different professional norms, and no shared infrastructure. Jorbex standardizes the process across 54 countries with multi-currency support (NGN, USD, GHS, KES, ZAR, XOF, XAF, EGP) and localized interfaces.

- **No integrated hiring workflow.** Most African employers juggle email, WhatsApp, spreadsheets, and phone calls to manage hiring. Jorbex provides application tracking, interview scheduling with built-in video (LiveKit), automated reminders, team collaboration via Mattermost integration, and offer management — all in one place.

### 3. For Global Employers Accessing African Talent

**Pain points we solve:**

- **They don't know where to start.** A tech company in Berlin or a finance firm in New York wants to hire African talent for remote roles. Where do they go? LinkedIn barely covers Africa. Local job boards are fragmented and unreliable. Jorbex is the single entry point to a verified, searchable, pan-African talent pool.

- **Trust deficit.** Global employers worry about credential fraud, communication gaps, and reliability. Jorbex's verification system, aptitude testing, and structured profiles give international employers the confidence to hire African talent sight-unseen — backed by data, not guesswork.

- **Compliance and communication.** Jorbex handles the interview infrastructure (video, scheduling, reminders), provides structured candidate data, and supports multi-language communication — removing the operational friction that stops global companies from tapping into Africa's talent.

- **Cost arbitrage with quality assurance.** African talent is significantly more cost-effective than Western equivalents, but only if you can verify quality. Jorbex makes this possible at scale.

## Section 2: Investor Pitch

### The Opportunity

**Africa's workforce will be 1.1 billion by 2030.** That's larger than China's and India's combined. The continent's working-age population is growing faster than anywhere else on Earth. Yet the infrastructure to connect this talent to opportunity barely exists.

The global recruitment market is worth $500 billion. Africa's share is growing at 15–20% annually, driven by:
- Rapid urbanization (Africa adds 25 million urban residents per year)
- Expanding internet penetration (from 28% in 2019 to 40%+ in 2025)
- The global shift to remote work post-COVID
- Increasing demand from Western companies for cost-effective, skilled talent

**Jorbex is building the talent infrastructure layer for an entire continent.**

---

### Why Jorbex Wins

**1. Verification-first approach.** Unlike LinkedIn or generic job boards, every Jorbex candidate goes through aptitude verification. This creates a trust layer that doesn't exist anywhere else in Africa. Employers don't just get resumes — they get verified, scored, comparable talent profiles.

**2. Full-stack hiring platform.** Jorbex isn't just a job board. It's the entire hiring workflow: job posting → candidate matching → aptitude testing → video interviews → offer management → onboarding. This creates deep lock-in and high switching costs.

**3. Multi-language, multi-currency from day one.** Most competitors start in one market and struggle to expand. Jorbex was built for pan-African scale from the beginning — English, French, Arabic, Portuguese; eight currencies; localized for every major African market.

**4. Mobile-first architecture.** 80% of African internet users access the web via mobile. Jorbex is built as a progressive web app with native mobile support via Capacitor. This isn't an afterthought — it's the foundation.

**5. Built-in communication infrastructure.** LiveKit video interviews, Mattermost team collaboration, push notifications, email automation — all integrated. Employers don't need to leave the platform.

### Comparable Exits & Market Signals

- **Andela** (Africa tech talent → global employers): Raised $381M, valued at $1.5B. Proved the model of African talent for global markets — but only for software engineers.
- **Jobberman** (West African job board): Acquired by ROAM Africa. Proved demand for digital recruitment in Africa — but no verification layer.
- **BrighterMonday** (East African job board): Part of ROAM Africa network. Proved the market in East Africa.
- **Deel, Remote, Oyster** (global remote hiring): Multi-billion dollar valuations. Proved global demand for distributed talent — but none focus on Africa's talent pipeline.

Jorbex sits at the intersection of all of these: verified African talent + full hiring workflow + global employer access. No one else is building this.

## Section 3: Viability & Revenue Potential

### Can Jorbex Make Money?

Yes. Here's the math.

**Employer subscriptions alone can build a sustainable business:**

| Scenario | Employers | Avg Monthly Revenue | MRR | ARR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 200 | $50 | $10,000 | $120,000 |
| Year 2 | 1,000 | $75 | $75,000 | $900,000 |
| Year 3 | 5,000 | $100 | $500,000 | $6,000,000 |

These are conservative numbers. Africa has over 3 million registered businesses in Nigeria alone. Kenya has 800,000+. The addressable market is enormous.

**Additional revenue layers compound this:**
- Assessment-as-a-Service: Employers pay per custom test or for bulk screening. At $5–$20 per assessment, 10,000 assessments/month = $50K–$200K/month.
- Global employer premium: International companies pay 3–5x local rates for access to verified African talent. Even 50 global employers at $500/month = $25K MRR.
- Data and analytics: Governments and NGOs pay for labor market insights. A single government contract can be worth $100K–$500K.

**Unit economics are favorable:**
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) for African employers: $20–$50 (digital marketing is cheap in Africa)
- Lifetime value (LTV) of an employer subscription: $600–$2,400 (12–24 month retention)
- LTV:CAC ratio: 12–48x (anything above 3x is considered excellent)

### Government Partnership Potential

This is one of Jorbex's strongest strategic advantages. Here's why governments will want to partner:

**1. Youth unemployment is the #1 political issue in Africa.**
Every African government is under pressure to create jobs and reduce youth unemployment. Jorbex provides a ready-made platform for workforce development programs. Instead of building their own (which they've tried and failed), governments can partner with Jorbex to:
- Register and verify youth talent at scale
- Match them to private sector opportunities
- Track employment outcomes with real data

**2. Skills gap data.**
Governments don't know what skills their workforce has or what employers need. Jorbex's aptitude testing and job posting data creates a real-time skills gap analysis that no government currently has. This data is extremely valuable for education policy, vocational training programs, and economic planning.

**3. Specific partnership models:**

| Partnership Type | Description | Revenue Model |
|---|---|---|
| National Youth Employment Programs | Government pays Jorbex to onboard, verify, and match youth to jobs | Per-candidate fee or annual contract |
| Vocational Training Integration | Link training programs to Jorbex profiles so graduates are immediately visible to employers | Government-funded or donor-funded |
| Diaspora Talent Return Programs | Help governments attract diaspora talent back by connecting them to local opportunities | Contract-based |
| Labor Market Intelligence | Provide anonymized workforce data and analytics to ministries of labor | Data subscription |
| Public Sector Hiring | Governments use Jorbex for their own recruitment (civil service, state enterprises) | Platform licensing |

**4. Target government partners:**
- **Nigeria:** Federal Ministry of Youth Development, National Directorate of Employment, state-level programs (Lagos, Ogun, Rivers)
- **Kenya:** National Employment Authority, Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project (World Bank-funded)
- **South Africa:** Department of Employment and Labour, Youth Employment Service (YES)
- **Rwanda:** Rwanda Development Board (known for tech-forward governance)
- **African Union:** Continental skills development initiatives
- **World Bank / AfDB / IFC:** Regularly fund employment platforms in developing markets. Jorbex is exactly the type of project they finance.

**5. Why this matters for investors:**
Government contracts provide:
- Large, predictable revenue ($100K–$1M+ per contract)
- Credibility and trust (government endorsement accelerates employer and candidate adoption)
- Data moats (government partnerships give access to population-level workforce data)
- Regulatory protection (partnered platforms are harder to displace)

---

### Long-Term Vision

Jorbex starts as a hiring platform. It becomes Africa's talent infrastructure.

- **Year 1–2:** Hiring platform. Job posting, candidate verification, interview management. Revenue from employer subscriptions.
- **Year 3–4:** Talent marketplace. Global employers access African talent for remote work. Assessment-as-a-Service becomes a standalone product. Government partnerships in 5+ countries.
- **Year 5+:** Workforce operating system. Jorbex profiles become the standard professional identity for African workers. Integration with payroll, benefits, training, and financial services. The "LinkedIn + Indeed + HireVue of Africa" — but built for Africa, not adapted from the West.

The company that builds the trusted talent layer for 1.4 billion people will be worth billions. Jorbex is building it.
